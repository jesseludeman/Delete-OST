# Remove-OST
We have a large amount of staff members using our desktop computers who all use Outlook 2016, so naturally this generates several very large .OST files on the local disk. Once the local disk completely fills up, it prevents our team from signing into our desktops. We identified that these files were the "safest" to delete from the affected machines, hence the creation of this quick and nasty script.
