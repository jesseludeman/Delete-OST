# Remove-OST
We have a large amount of staff members using our desktop computers who all use Outlook 2016, so naturally this generates several very large .OST files on the local disk. Once the local disk is full, this was effectively preventing our team members from using our computers, so I wrote this quick and nasty script to remove the files from the affected machines.
